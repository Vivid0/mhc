            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>The winery now known as Morgan Hill Cellars has seen ownership pass to three separate Italian
                families over the years. Though they faced many hardships the love of the business, the wines
                and the passion of its owners made the winery successful time and time again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year was 1913. Woodrow Wilson had just been sworn in as President of the United States.
                Congress had passed the 16th Amendment instituting a federal income tax. Turmoil in the Balkans
                foreshadowed the beginning of more terrible things to come. Suffragettes across the western
                world continued the struggle to grant women the right to vote. And the first ship would enter
                the Panama Canal.
            </p>
            <p>
                History-shaping events were taking place all over the world, but in the quiet, little,
                California town of Morgan Hill, a man would begin a legacy that would last for over a century.

                <p>
                    Camillo Colombano emigrated to the United States in the early 1900s from Piemonte in Northern
                    Italy. He and his two brothers, Eligio and Pietro arrived at Ellis Island with Barbera root
                    hidden in their shoes.

                <p>
                    Initially finding work in Connecticut, Camillo eventually moved to San Francisco where he and
                    his brothers worked delivering wine and brandy by horse and buggy.

                    Camillo was a man of impressive stature. Standing at 6’4”, his height along with his fair hair
                    and blue eyes meant that he always stood out in the crowd.

                Camillo began buying up land in Morgan Hill. By 1913, he owned 80 acres of rich, Santa Clara Valley
                soil.
                With Barbera root stock he’d brought over from Italy, he planted grapes and opened Colombano Winery that
                same year.

                    Fortunato Pedrizzetti along with his wife Louisa and son John emigrated to the United States in 1903
                    from Taino in the Lombardy region of Italy. The family eventually settled in San Martin, California,
                    just south of Morgan Hill.

                    after
                    Ed’s birth, John’s father, Fortunato, was killed in a farming accident.

            <p>
                John befriended a fellow immigrant by the name of Camillo Colombano. By the time Camillo was ready to
                retire
                from the wine business in 1945, John agreed to purchase the business from him. John changed the name to
                Pedrizzetti winery, expanded the range of varietals grown on the property and installed a truck scale in
                front of the first tank house. By 1968, John retired, passing the winery on to his son, Ed and
                daughter-in-law, Phyllis.

            <p>
                Ed and Phyllis worked together, using a divide-and-conquer strategy when it came to tackling the
                necessities
                of the wine business. Ed worked the vineyard, the bottling line and the delivery truck to fulfill orders
                while Phyllis designed the labels, managed the tasting room and went on to become the first female
                president
                of the Greater Santa Clara Valley Wine Growers Association.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the years, the Pedrizzettis faced several hardships, not the least of which was a devastating
                fire
                that destroyed a large portion of the winery in 1996. However, not the type to taking it lying down, Ed
                and
                Phyllis rebuilt and used the disaster as inspiration for a new name for the tasting room and a new
                label: La
                Fenice “The Phoenix”. Together Ed and Phyllis carried on for several more years finally selling the
                winery
                in 2006 and retiring to Montana.

                Michael “Mike” Sampognaro met Maryclaire McGarry while she and her family vacationed at a house in Long
                Island just next-door. The two were soon married and started a family of their own. Just before the
                birth of
                their third child, the couple decided to follow Mike’s father out to California.

                When they first arrived in California, Michael followed in his father’s footsteps starting a plastics
                business manufacturing decorative displays, vacuum forms and packaging for electronic components. After
                that, he continued with the entrepreneurial tradition, starting several other business including a
                machine shop and tire center.

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Maryclaire found work at National Semiconductor, one of the companies that would give Silicon
                Valley its namesake. Mike soon followed her into the high tech world working first for Apple Computer
                and
                then moving on to work in the video streaming space.
            </p>
            <p>
                After retiring from their high-tech carriers, Mike and Maryclaire purchased Pedrizzetti Winery in 2006.
                They
                look forward to carrying on the legacy of one of Santa Clara Valley’s oldest wineries.
